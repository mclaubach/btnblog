  <h2>trek up the hill</h2>
  <page intro>
      <p>out of breath you catch up to the pack</p>
      <p>"we thought you'd never make it" says omar, the mechanic's.</p>
      <p>"i aint never been to london" you say</p>

      <p>"reeeeeeee <i>reeeee</i>reeeee"</p>
      <p>In the clearing of the forest, there are three rocks, a tree, and, in another tree, a preposterous-looking owl.</p>
      <button choice investigate-rocks>I ought to investigate these rocks</button>
      <button choice check-tree-out>I want to check out this tree</button>
  </page>
  <page investigate-rocks>
      <p>You walk up to the pile of rocks.</p>
      <p>It's just a pile of rocks, you think.</p>
      <button choice look-around>Let's get out of here.</button>
  </page>
  <page check-tree-out>
      <p>You walk up to the tree. You reckon it to be mighty old. Maybe a bazillion years or more. You notice a strange carving on the tree.</p>
      <p>The carving depicts a great monster, twenty feet tall or more.</p>
      <p>"Pshh. A huge monster, have you ever heard anything so ridiculous, Smeemog? ... Smee?"</p>
      <p>You turn around, but in fact Smeemog has been eaten by a giant monster.</p>
      <p>The monster devours you as you beg for mercy.</p>

      <p>"Let's get out of here," you say to the dwarf.</p>
      <p>"Fool!" He shouts. "Fool!" But he follows anyways.</p>
      <p>After a short time, you see a bridge and, on the other side, the exit of the woods.</p>
      <p>As you are crossing, a fearsome troll climbs out from under the bridge.</p>
      <p>"Who dare to cross me bridge?" he bellows.</p>

  <page play-flute>
      <p>You play the flute, and the troll disappears in a cloud of smoke.</p>
      <p>"I'll get you, Owl!" he curses.</p>
      <p>You and Smeemog escape the forest safely.</p>
      <p><i>You win!</i>
